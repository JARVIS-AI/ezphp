EzPHP is an alternative to Xamp/Wamp. EzPHP is the easiest way to setup a PHP development environment for learning PHP on Windows.

### Installation

1. Download [ezphp.zip](https://github.com/marcomilon/ezphp/releases/download/1.1.0/ezphp.exe).
2. Copy ezphp.exe to your project folder. Its where you have your PHP files.
3. Run ezphp.exe. If PHP is not installed we may try to download and install PHP-7.0.0 in a local directory 
4. Open your browser in http://localhost:8080 

Advanced user execute `ezphp.exe -h` to view all options.

### How it works?

After launching ezphp.exe you will get a PHP web server on port 8080. 
To start programming with PHP just copy your PHP files to the **Document root** directory and then open the url **http://localhost:8080** on your web browser.

### Why i create EzPHP?

XAMP or equivalent environments are difficult to set up for users who are learning to code. With EzPHP you have a development environment with just one click.
EzPHP is available only for windows.

### Requirements

PHP binaries required to have *Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2017* installed on your computer.
You may have installed in your PC. In case you need it you can download it from https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145

### Can i use EzPHP on command line (e.g. PowerShell)?

No, EzPHP does not support running PHP from command line.
